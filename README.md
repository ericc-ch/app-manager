# App Manager

## Overview

`app-manager` is a command-line tool designed to manage my installed applications. It provides commands to install and delete applications, currently only supports Windsurf.

### Why

Windsurf is currently not officially available for Arch based distros. An AUR package exists, but currently it's not popular and I don't want to read the PKGBUILD everytime I want to install Windsurf.

### Features

- Install Windsurf: Downloads and installs the latest version of Windsurf.
- Delete Windsurf: Deletes the Windsurf installation.

### Usage

To use `app-manager`, run the following commands:

- `app-manager windsurf install`: Installs Windsurf.
- `app-manager windsurf delete`: Deletes Windsurf.
